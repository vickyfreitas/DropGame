# Raindrop Collector Game

This is a simple game developed using Java and the libGDX framework. The game was developed as a learning project and represents my first application.

## Overview

In this game, the player controls a bucket to catch falling raindrops. The game keeps track of how many raindrops have been collected.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- libGDX
- Gradle

## Features

- Raindrop spawning
- Bucket movement controlled by user input
- Collision detection between the bucket and the raindrops
- Score tracking

## Setup

To run this project, you need to have Java and Gradle installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the project using your IDE (Android Studio is recommended)

## Code Structure

The main game logic is contained in the `GameScreen.java` file. This includes the rendering of the game objects (bucket and raindrops), processing user input, and updating the game state.

## Future Improvements

This project was a great learning experience and there are several potential improvements that could be made, such as adding more game features, improving the UI, and optimizing the code.
